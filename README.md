This plugin is for serious Otaku programmers.
Code with your waifu. With over **20** themes,
I think you will find best girl.

You can choose themes from various, Anime, Manga, or Visual Novels:

- Doki-Doki Literature Club
- Re:Zero
- Kill La Kill
- KonoSuba
- DanganRonpa
- High School DxD
- Lucky Star
- Sword Art Online

Sticker in the way? No worries! You can configure them to be on or off at your leisure.

These themes are easy to install, there are minimal configurations, so you can enjoy the themes faster.
They also play well with other themes, so feel free to come and go as your mood changes :)
